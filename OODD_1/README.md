## Reservation Constraints
* 2 hour time slot
* Member cannot reserve multiple room reservations at the same time
* Admin can reserve more than one room for a member at the same time
* Reservations cannot be made more than one week in advance
* No overlapping of room reservations

## Testing
* We have tested the rooms controller and rooms model.

### Test Cases
* Admin can create a room with room details
* Admin cannot create a room without a room ID
* Admin can save a room
* Admin can update a room
* Admin cannot save a room with duplicate room ID
* Admin can delete a room

## Extra Credit Features
* While booking a room the email addresses of the attendees can be entered and notification emails will be sent. Please enter valid email addresses.
* At a particular date and time, an admin can reserve more than one room for a member. 

## Scope for Improvement
* UI needs to be improved 
* While booking, there is a necessity to enter date twice
* The user session is saved for 10 minutes after which the user automatically logs out. This is done because the user session is saved if he/she forgets to logout before closing the browser and the another user can access the the previous user's account. To prevent this we explicitly made the session last for 10 minutes.
